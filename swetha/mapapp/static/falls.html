    <h1>Agasthiyar Falls</h1>
    <p>
        Agasthiyar Falls is a picturesque waterfall located near Papanasam in the Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu. 
        Flowing from the Tamirabarani River, it is set amidst the lush forests of the Western Ghats and holds religious 
        significance, as it's believed Sage Agasthya once meditated here. A popular spot for nature lovers and pilgrims 
        alike, the falls are best visited post-monsoon for their full beauty.
